## Overview

### The challenge

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## My process

### Built with

- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.cool-thing-i-learned {
  backdrop-filter: hue-rotate(85deg) saturate(35%) brightness(70%);
}
```
Never knew about the filter function, I used it because the color given in styling didn't correspond to the final screenshot design. Also learnt that SASS has a lighten() and darken() function, which is very handy.

### Continued development

Learn more about animation, I tried the bonus challenge but didn't succeed (also maybe because the template might have been a little bit off for this).
Also do more responsive design, because I only did the size given in the styling guide (1440x800 and 375x667)
